# Emotion Classification

## Overview

This project focuses on **Emotion Classification** using **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** techniques. The goal is to classify text into various emotion categories such as happiness, sadness, anger, fear, surprise, etc. Emotion classification is essential for applications such as sentiment analysis, customer feedback analysis, social media monitoring, and mental health monitoring.

The model is trained to recognize different emotions in text, allowing for a better understanding of human sentiment and emotional states in written content.

## Features

- **Text-based Emotion Recognition**: Classifies text into predefined emotion categories.
- **Multiple Emotion Classes**: Capable of detecting various emotions like happy, sad, angry, etc.
- **NLP Models**: Uses traditional machine learning algorithms as well as deep learning techniques for text classification.
- **Preprocessing Pipeline**: Includes text preprocessing like tokenization, stemming, stop-word removal, etc.

## Dataset

The model is trained on publicly available emotion-labeled datasets. Examples include:

- **Emotion-Intensified Dataset**
- **ISEAR Dataset (International Survey on Emotion Antecedents and Reactions)**

These datasets contain text samples along with associated emotion labels, providing the necessary training data for the model.

## Model

The project includes both traditional and deep learning approaches to emotion classification:

- **Traditional ML Models**: Algorithms like **Support Vector Machines (SVM)**, **Naive Bayes**, and **Random Forest**.
- **Deep Learning Models**: Implementing advanced architectures like **LSTM**, **GRU**, and **Transformer-based models** (e.g., **BERT**) for better accuracy and context understanding.

## Installation

To run this project locally, follow these steps:

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have Python 3.x installed. You will also need to install the dependencies listed in the `requirements.txt` file.

### Steps to Install:

1. **Clone the repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Emotion-Classification.git
   cd Emotion-Classification
   ```

2. **Create a virtual environment** (optional but recommended):

   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`
   ```

3. **Install dependencies**:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

### Running the Emotion Classifier

Once the environment is set up, you can run the classifier on any input text:

```bash
python emotion_classifier.py
```

The script will classify the input text into one or more emotional categories.

### Example

Run the script and input a text string for emotion classification:

```bash
python emotion_classifier.py
```

Example input:
```text
"I am so excited about this project!"
```

Example output:
```text
Predicted Emotion(s): Happy, Excited
```

### Training the Model

If you want to train the model with your custom dataset, follow these steps:

1. Prepare your dataset in a CSV format with two columns: `text` and `emotion`.
2. Modify the script `train_model.py` to load your dataset.
3. Run the following to train the model:

   ```bash
   python train_model.py
   ```

This will train the model and save the trained model to a file for future use.

## Models Used

1. **Traditional Models**: Using libraries such as **Scikit-learn** for algorithms like SVM, Naive Bayes, and Random Forest.
2. **Deep Learning Models**: Using **TensorFlow** or **PyTorch** for models like **LSTM**, **GRU**, and **BERT**.
